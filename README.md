# Erin Ewart Portfolio

## Description

In this project I refactored existing code for the Horiseon website.  I added semantic HTML, organized and removed unnecessary code and made sure all links worked appropriately.  I also added alt text for images to increase user accessibility as well as comments in the HTML and CSS files to increase the readability of the code for future coders.

## Languages Used

- HTML
- CSS
